# Microsegregation
This repository contains python scripts to calculate different microsegregation models. The codes for models discussed in the manuscript titled "Modelling Microsegregation during Metal Additive Manufacturing: Impact of Dendrite Tip Kinetics and Finite Solute Diffusion". The codes will be uploaded once the manuscript is accepted for publication. Preprint for the manuscript can be found in the link [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202304.0005/v1]{https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202304.0005/v1}
